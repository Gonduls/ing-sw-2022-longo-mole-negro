## 2. Scenarios

### 2.1 Game Access

To better describe what happens in the "Game Access" phase, seen as we decided to implement the multiple simultaneous games mechanic, we will divide into two separate sequence diagrams what actions take place.

#### 2.1.1 Login

<img src="Login.png">

Seen as the Username univocally identifies the player, the login phase makes sure that the player cannot log in until a unique name is given. We can see the ack/nack mechanic shown in this diagram: such aspect of the protocol is used in all scenarios, but for simplicity, we will omit it from this point forth.

#### 2.1.2 Accessing a Room

<img src="Access room.png">

We can see here how there are two ways of entering a new game: by creating a new room or by accessing an initializing room. Trying to acces a non initializing room or a non-exhisting room will result in a Nack. Users can furthermore search for a public room's id, or enter a private room id, to join in a new game. Creating a room will always result into joining said room.

### 2.2 Planning Phase

<img src="Planning phase.png">

In the planning phase the turn changes according to the order in which players are to select an Assistant card. During this turn change the current playing player can only pick the assistant according to the rules. After the planning phase a new order is decided for the rest of the round.
