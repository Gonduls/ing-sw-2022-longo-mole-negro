## 2. Scenarios

### 2.1 Game Access

To better describe what happens in the "Game Access" phase, since we decided to implement the multiple simultaneous games mechanic, we will divide into two separate sequence diagrams what actions take place.

#### 2.1.1 Login

<img src="Login.png">

Given that the Username univocally identifies the player, the login phase makes sure that the player cannot log in until a unique name is given. We can see the ack/nack mechanic shown in this diagram: such aspect of the protocol is used in all scenarios, but for simplicity, we will omit it from this point forth.

#### 2.1.2 Accessing a Room

<img src="Access room.png">

We can see here how there are two ways of entering a new game: by creating a new room or by accessing an initializing room. Trying to acces a non initializing room or a non-exhisting room will result in a Nack. Users can furthermore search for a public room's id, or enter a private room id, to join in a new game. Creating a room will always result into joining said room.

### 2.2 Planning Phase

<img src="Planning phase.png">

In the planning phase the turn changes according to the order in which players are to select an Assistant card. During this turn change the current playing player can only pick the assistant according to the rules. After the planning phase, a new order is decided for the rest of the round. Like we said before, we omitted the ack/nack for simplicity, but for completeness, a nack will be sent to the player that plays out of turn or that plays a wrong card.


### 2.3 Action Phase 1
In this phase the player must move three students. These actions are represented by the events: 
- MOVE_STUDENTS_FROM_ENTRANCE_TO_ISLAND
- MOVE_STUDENTS_FROM_ENTRANCE_TO_TABLE

If the action wanted by the player is, for some reason, illegal, a nack is sent by the controller.

For the sake of clearness in this diagram is omitted the possibility of activating a character card.
<img src="action1.png">


### 2.4 Action Phase 2 
In this phase the player moves mother nature. 
The action is represented by the event: MOVE_MOTHER_NATURE.

If the movement triggered a movement of towers and/or the merging of islands an update event will be sent to the client.


If the action wanted by the player is, for some reason, illegal, a nack is sent by the controller.
For the sake of clearness in this diagram is omitted the possibility of activating a character card.
<img src ="action2-single.jpeg">

### 2.5 Action Phase 3

In this phase the player chooses a cloud.
The action is represented by the event: CHOOSE_CLOUD_TILE.

If the action wanted by the player is, for some reason, illegal, a nack is sent by the controller.
For the sake of clearness in this diagram is omitted the possibility of activating a character card.
<img src="action3-single.jpeg">

### 2.6 EndGame

<img src="EndGame.png">

When the game ends, a simple EndGame message is sent to all clients with the list of all winning players. The controller then waits for all clients to leave the room before ending its funcions. Clients are free to still join another room or logout from the server.
